To use, run a scoreboard operation on any entity's `hp_dmg` or `hp_max` scores

For example,

`/scoreboard players set LukeVanHemert hp_dmg 5` will deal 5 points of damage to LukeVanHemert

`/scoreboard players set RubyEvilEye hp_dmg -5` will increase RubyEvilEye's health by 5 points

The `hp_max` score will behave the same, except it will alter an entity's *maximum* health
